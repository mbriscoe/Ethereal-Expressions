# Ethereal Expressions

This project is to develop a website for the artist Adamma Anwen Lloyd, with the goal of showcasing her work and attracting potential clients or buyers. We aim to include a gallery page with high-quality images of her work, an about the artist page and a contact form for enquiries or purchases. 

As far as the user is concerned, they should be able to view Adamma's work and contact her for any commissions or purchases. This should be covered within our intended site.

In terms of design, there should be a cohesive colour scheme and set of styles across the whole site to reiterate the artist's brand. Site layout should enhance rather than impede the user experience to give a welcoming, intuitive feel. Finally, the site layout should be responsive to enable easy navigation on all devices.

## Features

- **Navigation Bar**

Navigation is provided via a bootstrap navbar. CSS code has been added to underline menu items on hover and tint the navbar for each page. Font Awesome icons have been added to each menu item to add visual clues.

- **The Footer**

The page footer is arranged in 2 rows. The first row contains social media links for the site and the second row contains links to the site team's GitHub pages.
The footer layout was created using CSS flex.

### Home Page

The Home page is formed by a carousel built on Bootstrap as the main element, a gradient banner, and two Bootstrap grids, the first one with two images and two pieces of text and the second one with  four images on the same row. The first element, the carousel is built up to catch the users' attention when they first visit the site and inform them about the content to expect through the site. Following the carousel, a banner works as a transitional element between the carousel and the content. 

The gradient style of the banner uses the same colours as the images chosen for the first grid and its borders. Finally, the last point  is the use of representative images of the painter and her creative process taking place, in order to provide relevant visual information about the quality of the artist’s work.

### About Page

The About page is compounded by two pictures, followed by two pieces of text. Bootstrap grid has been used to fit them on the page and make them responsive. For smaller devices, the elements collapse one on top of each other, having the images at the top and the bottom, and the text, in the center.  For devices with higher resolution such as tablets, laptops and desk computers, the elements expand evenly in two rows, and each element takes  50 per cent of the space available.

### Gallery Page

The gallery page contains eight four-piece collections from the artist, displayed in a grid using Bootstrap CSS. The user can click on any of the pieces to see it full-size, and an on-hover shadow effect highlights image as the mouse passes over them.

### Contact Page

The contact page is comprised of two parts. First, there is a contact form for users to get in touch with the artist. This give options to submit either a general enquiry, a purchase enquiry or to contact about a commission. 

The second part of the page deals with contact details for the artist giving a portrait photo, contact details and an embedded map showing her location.

This page was structured using bootstrap.

### Content

- The quotation that appears on our home page belongs to Arshile Gorky. We have found it at https://www.azquotes.com/quote/709942?ref=abstract-art
- The icons in the header and footer were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- The quotes on the home page were create by our team member Martina!

### Media

- For this project, our team has made use of different platforms in order to obtain visual content. The first platform that has been chosen for the content of this website is IDDLE, a platform that belongs to ChatGPT. This platform allows the user to generate images with AI without the need of a copyright license, which was suitable for our project. 

- However, it is worth mentioning that before generating our images, key aspects such as: the colour palette selection, the painting technique and the topics by which the different art collections would inspired,  all of these fundamental points, were the result of a dynamic creative process. Besides, our team was also in charge of the design of our protagonist character, its identity and collections. 

- Apart from using IDDLE for most of the visual elements in the website, as well, our team decided to utilise specific suitable images for our carousel on our home page. Firstly,  we visited the website  Unsplash .com and selected images that could be expanded nicely. With our selected images prepared, our team manipulated their sizes with the help of Adobe Fireworks, an image manipulation program.
